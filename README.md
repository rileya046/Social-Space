# Social Space
### "Helping To Get Your Social Plans Off the Launch Pad!"

# 2025 Hackathon Project Goal

The goal was to make a website to get plans from the group chat to a real "Social Space" through a simple interactive space mission.

# The Setting
You are working in ground control: Your Mission?
- Get this spaceship from your home star of "Group Chat" to the illusive "Event" Planet! 

Choose the three most important tasks to make your mission a success and input them to your computer as "tasks". Each successfully completed task will dim once checked off, so it is easy to tell what is left to complete. Every setback will send your ship back, and each success will send it forward.

Can you make your plans leave your texts and escape to somewhere beyond the stars?

# Hackathon Project Details
- Three task progress points (represented through stars) with the goal of reaching the planet (Your Event)
- A rocket ship that travels between stars to represent task progress
- Completion message that resets the "mission"
- Small Interactive Elements in the Space Setting (spinning stars and spaceship idle animation when hovering over the object)
- floating Tuffy the Titan animation in space for a more immersive feel
- An old-fashioned computer screen design for the tasks
- custom assets for design originality
