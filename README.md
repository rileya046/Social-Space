## HTML? CSS? ü§î 
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It consists of a series of tags and attributes that are used to structure and format the content of a web page. HTML is used to define the different parts of a web page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation of a web page. It is used to control the visual appearance of the HTML elements defined in the web page. With CSS, you can specify the color, font, size, and layout of the elements on the page, as well as control how they are displayed on different devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

=> In simpler terms, HTML is used to create the content and structure of a web page, while CSS is used to control how the page looks and feels. Together, HTML and CSS are used to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.
